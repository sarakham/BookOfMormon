Behold, we know that thou art Alma; and we know that thou art high priest over the church which thou hast established in many parts of the land, according to your tradition; and we are not of thy church, and we do not believe in such foolish traditions. And now we know that because we are not of thy church we know that thou hast no power over us; and thou hast delivered up the judgment-seat unto Nephihah; therefore thou art not the chief judge over us.

Who art thou? Suppose ye that we shall believe the testimony of one man, although he should preach unto us that the earth should pass away?

We will not believe thy words if thou shouldst prophesy that this great city should be destroyed in one day.

Who is God, that sendeth no more authority than one man among this people, to declare unto them the truth of such great and marvelous things?

This man doth revile against our laws which are just, and our wise lawyers whom we have selected.

Now we know that this man is a child of the devil, for he hath lied unto us; for he hath spoken against our law. And now he says that he has not spoken against it. And again, he has reviled against our lawyers, and our judges.

Art thou also possessed with the devil?
