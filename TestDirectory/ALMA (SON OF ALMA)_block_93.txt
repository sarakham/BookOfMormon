And/RB
now/RB
my/PP$

I/PP

there/EX
is/VBZ
somewhat/RB
more/JJR
which/WDT

your/PP$

which/WDT
ye/DT

concerning/IN
the/DT

in/IN

for/IN
ye/DT

that/IN
it/PP

injustice/NN
that/IN
the/DT

be/VB
consigned/VBN
to/TO
a/DT

Now/RB
behold/VBP
my/PP$

I/PP
will/MD
explain/VB
this/DT
thing/NN
unto/IN
thee/PP
For/IN
behold/VBP
after/IN
the/DT
Lord/NP
God/NP
sent/VBD
our/PP$

he/PP
drew/VBD
out/RP
the/DT

he/PP
placed/VBD
at/IN

Now/RB
we/PP

that/IN
the/DT
