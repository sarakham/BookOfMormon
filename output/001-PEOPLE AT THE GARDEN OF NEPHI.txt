Let this man alone, for he is a good man, and those things which he saith will surely come to pass except we repent; Yea, behold, all the judgments will come upon us which he has testified unto us; for we know that he has testified aright unto us concerning our iniquities. And behold they are many, and he knoweth as well all things which shall befall us as he knoweth of our iniquities; Yea, and behold, if he had not been a prophet he could not have testified concerning those things.
