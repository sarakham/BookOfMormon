Yea, Lord, Samuel did prophesy according to thy words, and they were all fulfilled.

Lord, we will that thou wouldst tell us the name whereby we shall call this church; for there are disputations among the people concerning this matter.

In the name of Jesus Christ I ordain you to be a priest,

I ordain you to be a teacher, to preach repentance and remission of sins through Jesus Christ, by the endurance of faith on his name to the end. Amen.
