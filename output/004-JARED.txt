Cry again unto the Lord, and it may be that he will turn away his anger from them who are our friends, that he confound not their language.

Go and inquire of the Lord whether he will drive us out of the land, and if he will drive us out of the land, cry unto him whither we shall go. And who knoweth but the Lord will carry us forth into a land which is choice above all the earth? And if it so be, let us be faithful unto the Lord, that we may receive it for our inheritance.

Suffer them that they may have a king.

I will give her unto you, if ye will bring unto me the head of my father, the king.
